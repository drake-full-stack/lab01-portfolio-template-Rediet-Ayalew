## Answer
- When completing this assigenment, I struggled with increasing the font size, adding color, and fixing small technichal errors. I wanted to have a seperate file for the header and the footer but I found out that it is not going to be possible with out Javascripts. Throughout this assignment, I have learned to write html from scratch and use Emmet as a Shortcut system which makes coding easier. For the future, I want to add CSS which makes the website more lively and interactive. I want to add animations,style it and make the website look professional.
